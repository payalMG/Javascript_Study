//Q1- Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.
// Ans-  “ == “ - Checks if values are the same.
            //    Ignores the type conversion.

    //   “ === “  - Compares both value and type. 
                    // First two equals check values and last equal checks datatypes.      
                    
//Q2- What are the differences between var, let and const?                    
//Ans- Var- This is globally scope and it is reassign the values and also re-declaration the variable.
       //let- This is block scope and it is reassign te values but can not re-declaration the variables.
       //const- This is block scope and we can not resaasign and re-declaration.

//Q3- What is execution context?    
//Ans- Execution Context it is Environment where JS runs code.
    // It tracks what’s happening while the code runs.   

//Q4- What is creation phase and execution phase?    
//Ans- Creation Phase - Reserves memory, sets undefined, stores functions.
     //Execution Phase - Runs the code step-by-step.

//Q5- What is hoisting?
//Ans- Hoisting means JavaScript moves declarations to the top of the code before running it.

//Q6- Difference between undefined vs not defined vs NaN.
//Ans-  undefined - The variable is declared, but no value is given yet.
       //not defined - The variable was never declared at all.
       //NaN - Not a Number (invalid math).

//Q7- How many operators do we have in JS ?    
//Ans- The main types of operators in JavaScript in a simple way- : 

//1- Arithmetic Operators - +, -, *, /, %, *.
//2- Comparison Operators - ==, ===, !=, >, <.
//3- Bitwise Operators.
//4- Increment and Decrement Operators - (a++,++a,a--,--a,).
//5 - Logical Operators - (&&, ||,!).
//6 - Ternary Opeartors - condition ? a : b
//7 - Comma Operators -(,).

//Q8- Explain Local Scope, Block Scope, Functional Scope and Scope Chain in javascript?
//Ans-  Local Scope -	Variable inside a function. It Can only be used inside that function.
//Functional Scope -  var does not follow block scope, only function scope.
                    //So, var inside a block {} is still visible outside the block (not safe).
//Block Scope - Variable inside {} using let/const.   
//Scope Chain - If a variable is not found in the current scope, JavaScript looks up to the outer scope.
